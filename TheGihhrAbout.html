		<p>The Global Institute for Health and Human Rights is based at the University at Albany in New York State.
		We have a number of ongoing international projects in the areas of drug policy, environment, international health law, criminal justice,
		HIV/AIDS prevention and care, and human rights advocacy, research & health policy.
		We strive to be interdisciplinary in both our analysis of global health issues and in our approach to addressing them.</p><br>

		<div id="three-column1">

				<h2>Our Vision</h2><br>
				</div>
			<p>Health and human rights are deeply interconnected.
			Improving the well-being of the population requires that everyone,
			without discrimination, have access to good-quality health services.
			Moreover, good health is necessary to realize other basic human rights.
			Thus, health is itself a basic human right, and it is an important precondition
			for the meaningful fulfillment of a wide range of other human rights. </p>

			<p>To understand and protect health as a human right,
			it is imperative to identify and solve social problems on a large scale.
			Those working in health and human rights must be “social entrepreneurs”,
			change agents who seize opportunities to improve upon old systems and paradigms.
			Historic shifts — changes in women’s rights, the spread of political freedoms,
			access to education, the expansion of rights for workers — have always been engendered by these social entrepreneurs and change agents. </p>

			<p>Around the world, global issues like HIV, population growth, human rights,
			and poverty have galvanized people and organizations with shared interests to become agents of social change.
			The Institute is positioned to be a part of these important shifts,
			and to lead creative efforts to find sustainable solutions in domains such as education, healthcare,
			human rights, prison reform, etc. to best meet these challenges. The Institute hopes to be in the vanguard of these agents of change,
			and to empower a new generation of “social entrepreneurs” who advance social progress on a global scale in the interest
			of the promotion of health and human rights.</p>

	<!--MISSION-->
	<div id="welcome">
		<div class="container">
			<div class="title">
				<h2>Mission</h2><br>
			</div>
			<p>The Global Institute for Health and Human Rights aims to facilitate a deeper understanding
			of the intersection between health and human rights, with concentration on reproductive health,
			Maternal and child care, HIV/AIDS prevention and Harm Reduction to develop innovative solutions
			to contemporary challenges in this arena through research, education, policy, advocacy and development. </p>

			<p>The connection between and importance of health and human rights is undeniable,
			yet challenges to their realization remain. The concept of health as a human right
			is not widely accepted, even among many ministries, secretariats of health, civil society,
			and organizations representing the interests of the most vulnerable.
			There is insufficient collaboration between individuals working in the field of medicine
			and those working from a legal or policy perspective to protect human rights, and little understanding
			of how their work is linked. There are persistent human rights violations world-wide with respect to health,
			and inadequate protection of health leaves people without the ability to fulfill their other basic rights.
			To meaningfully promote health and human rights their connection must be widely accepted and understood,
			and there must be collective support of their universal protection.</p>

			<p>The challenge to universal enjoyment of health as a human right is complex and multi-faceted.
			It is related to politics and policy, and to an intricate local, regional and international legal framework.
			It comes from inequalities and prejudices with respect to gender, race, sexuality, and culture.
			It relates to resource allocation and wealth disparities, and to the rate of development in countries throughout the world.
			It is closely connected to crime and punishment, and to international relations and world conflict. And there are, of course,
			important questions of ethics and moral responsibility. Addressing this challenge will require and equally complex and multi-faceted approach,
			through cooperation and collaboration across fields such as law, medicine, public health, philosophy, sociology, social welfare, psychology,
			political science, criminal justice, public administration, urban planning, women’s studies and more.</p>

				<h2>History</h2><br>
				</div>
			<p>The Global Institute for Health and Human Rights was founded in 2012 by Doctors Kamiar Alaei and Arash Alaei
			along with other committed health and human rights professionals, borne out of a recognition of the disconnect
			between health and human rights on all levels.</p>

			<p>One of the first campaigns by the Institute was the first annual Health and Human Rights Week in December 2012,
			which joined both professional and student organizations, culminating in a keynote address by Dr. Kamiar Alaei.
			That year, the Institute also presided over the creation of a Center for Health and Human rights in Virginia,
			the first of its kind and to include affordable healthcare services.</p>

			<p>In February 2013, the Institute partnered with the PAHO/WHO Human Rights team to conduct
			the First Training Workshop on Health and Human Rights. This meeting gathered young health and human rights professionals
			to set the groundwork for the creation of the WHO/PAHO First Framework on Health and Human Rights for Prisoners.</p>

			<p>In March 2013, the Institute was officially recognized by the University at Albany Council on Research.</p>
