			<h2><center>Opens the doors to International Opportunities, Humanitarian Approaches, and Prospective Careers</center></h2><br>
			<p>GIHHR is recruiting new interns who want to participate in international research projects on substance use and HIV risk in the United States,
			Middle Eastern countries, Africa, and Asia. For the past years, we have built strong affiliation with World Health Organization (WHO),
			United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC), many other international non-for-profit organizations, and federal agencies.
			Our work aims at improving the health status of vulnerable populations such as women, youth, refugees, immigrants, injecting drug users,
			and other socially marginalized groups.</p>
			
			<p>Internship at GIHHR provides an unique opportunity for undergraduate and graduate students. Being an intern at GIHHR can get first-hand,
			real-life experiences that translate useful knowledge into practice across multiple academic disciplines. Our interns are from various departments
			such as Public Health, Criminal Justice, Law, Medicine, Economics, Anthropology, Sociology, Public Administration, Political Science,
			Social Welfare, Psychology, Human Bio, Globalization, Business, Computer Science, Communications, and many others. Interns may also develop 
			research agenda that eventually lead to practicum, thesis, dissertation, and career planning. Accepted interns are eligible to receive academic 
			credit for their work through the RSSW program.</p>
			
			<p>After completion of internship, student can get the training certificate officially recognized by University at Albany.
			Built on GIHHR internship, many of our interns also volunteer or do their summer internship at federal and international organizations,
			such as UNAIDS, NIH, PHR, CDC, and SAMHSA. In addition to University at Albany, our interns have received offers of admission from other top-ranked
			graduate programs such as Johns Hopkins University, Tufts University, Boston University, Northwestern University, and New York University. 
			In 2015, one of our interns received the UAlbany Presidential Award for Undergraduate Research. In 2016, one of our interns gets accepted into the
			Amgen Scholar Program at the National Institute of Health (NIH), one of the most prestigious  scholarly health programs on the East Coast.</p>
			
			<p>Please prepare your CV  and a cover letter that includes a brief description of your research interests, and your academic training background
			relevant to public health, substance use, HIV, international law, or human rights and contact our intern coordinators, September Johnson
			and Christina Ehret at gihhrinterns@gmail.com</p>
			
			<p>There are no due dates for internship application during the Fall and Spring semesters.
			Eligible students will be scheduled to meet with our director Dr. Kamiar Alaei.</p>
