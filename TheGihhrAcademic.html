					<h3>ETH 510: Health Care and Human Values</h3><br>
					<p>This three-credit course in the final semester of didactic courses is designed to provide students with a capstone experience
					involving thought-provoking readings from literature and current publications.
					This course will provide students with the opportunity to progress further through Bloom’s taxonomy as they explore the various topics
					of this capstone course. Progressing from general concerns about one’s life
					(such as recognizing the importance of passion in a person’s life) to the increasingly specific concerns about serving as a valuable,
					moral member of a profession (such as realizing the importance of empathy for a patient dying of ovarian cancer),
					the themes covered in this course relate to the larger issues of our students’ profession.
					This course exposes the students to works that treat the topics of health care and human values,
					the responsibilities of the scientist, the use of drugs in our society, and alleviation of suffering;
					this course provides the students with the opportunity to explore these themes in written and discussion form.
					This course will count towards a joint program between colleges of Pharmacy and MBA program in Union Graduate College</p>
					
					<h3>SOC 420/520 HSP Health and Social Policy</h3><br>

					This course aims to help you develop critical thinking skills.<br>

					· What is the key development of social and specifically health policy in the US?<br>
					· What are the contemporary issues, problems and controversies in American health care and policy?<br>

					<h3>ETH515: Health, Disease and Authority in Medicine</h3><br>
					<p>ETH515 will focus specifically on the themes of health, illness and disease, medical technology & knowledge,
					and the role of power and authority in medicine. What is it like to make moral, informed,
					and well-considered medical decisions in light of modern (and future) medical knowledge?
					In this course, we will begin with a brief historical analysis of how the roles of patients and of clinicians have changed,
					reflecting the success of bioethical approaches from philosophy, religion, and other disciplines.
					We will ask, what it means to be a “good” patient and a “good” clinician.
					ETH 515 also strengthens, through rigorous practice, academic and professional reading, writing, and speaking skills.
					Contemporary patients and clinicians face the necessary but daunting task of trying to make use of both medical technologies
					and medial knowledge, which are growing rapidly and becoming ever more complex. In the second half of the course,
					our focus will shift to how health, disease, and illness are constructed,
					as well as underlying power dynamics in medical knowledge and decision-making.</p>

					The assessment of health status through epidemiological and anthropological methods is explored. Master of Anthropology</p>
					
					<h3>ANT 670: Seminar in Ethnology- Human Rights, Humanitarianism and Development</h3><br>
					<p>This class This course is designed to provide an overview of human rights and anthropology from theoretical and historical points
					of view and from the vantage point of engagement and practice. Using a critical approach,
					we will move away from the notion of a set category or monolithic legal structure toward an understanding of a flexible
					and elastic set of conceptual frameworks used to accomplish transitions, make claims and gain access to resources,
					in village meetings as well as international halls of power. In doing so, we will consider the increasing transnationalization
					of rights discourse and the growing terrain in which claims, legal and otherwise, are made through it.
					A series of international and national case studies will be examined. Master of Anthropology</p>
					
					<h3>HIS 603: Readings in the US History- Human Rights, the United States, and International History</h3><br>

					In part two, we will examine how human rights concerns influenced U.S. foreign policy in the last half of the twentieth century.
					In part three, we will look at human rights in relation to domestic politics and culture in the modern United States.
					In covering these areas, students will learn about important aspects of modern American history, including the Civil Rights movement,
					the New Deal, the Cold War, and the modern labor movement. Such topics will lead us to one other central concern:
					the ways in which United States history can profitably be placed in an international context. Master of Public History</p>
					
					<h3>RCRJ 720: Seminars on Specific Problems in Law and Social Control- Wrongful Convictions</h3><br>
					<p>This course is designed to offer an overview of wrongful convictions. We expect to examine the prevalence of wrongful convictions,
					how wrongful arrests and convictions occur (contributing factors), how the criminal justice system responds
					(through court decisions, legislation, and administrative initiatives),
					and how legal decisions affect the direction of scientific research and vice versa.
					This is an interdisciplinary course for students who are interested in criminal justice, psychology, and legal issues.
					Upon completion of the course, we anticipate that students will have acquired an understanding of relevant case law and research 
					on wrongful convictions, and to have acquired specific knowledge about eyewitness accuracy, expert witness issues, false confessions, 
					snitches, the roles of the police, prosecutors, defense counsel, and courts in helping cause, prevent, and correct wrongful convictions,
					forensic evidence issues, and the consequences of wrongful convictions, among other issues. Master of Criminal Justice</p>
